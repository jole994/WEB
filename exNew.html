Borders
Create three paragraphs on the page
All of them should have a yellow background
Each paragraph should have a 5px thick border
The first and the last paragraphs should have red dashed borders

Padding
Use the previous example or create three new paragraphs with bg color
Set padding for each paragraph
The first and the third should have a 50px padding around all sides
The middle one should have a 50px top padding only

Margins
Use the previous example and add margins to each element
The first should be 300px wide and should have 50px margins around all sides

        <p class="par1">Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly colorless chemical substance,
             which is the main constituent of Earth's hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms
              (in which it acts as a solvent[1]). It is vital for all known forms of life, even though it provides
              no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical formula is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules 
              contains one oxygen and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. Two hydrogen atoms are 
              attached to one oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.[2]Water plays an important role in the world economy.
               Approximately 70% of the freshwater used by humans goes to agriculture.[6] Fishing in salt and fresh water bodies
                is a major source of food for many parts of the world. Much of the long-distance trade of commodities
                 (such as oil, natural gas, and manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers, 
                 lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used for cooling and heating, in 
                 industry and homes. Water is an excellent solvent for a wide variety of substances both mineral and
                  organic; as such it is widely used in industrial processes, and in cooking and washing. Water, ice 
                  and snow are also central to many sports and other forms of entertainment, such as swimming, pleasure
                   boating, boat racing, surfing, sport fishing, diving, ice skating and skiing.On a pressure/temperature 
                   phase diagram (see figure), there are curves separating solid from vapor, vapor from liquid, and liquid 
                   from solid. These meet at a single point called the triple point, where all three phases can coexist. The
                    triple point is at a temperature of 273.16 K (0.01 °C) and a pressure of 611.657 pascals (0.00604 atm);
                    [32] it is the lowest pressure at which liquid water can exist. Until 2019, the triple point was used to
                     define the Kelvin temperature scale.[33][34]
                   The water/vapor phase curve terminates at 647.096 K (373.946 °C; 705.103 °F) and 22.064 
                   megapascals (3,200.1 psi; 217.75 atm).[35] This is known as the critical point. At higher
                    temperatures and pressures the liquid and vapor phases form a continuous phase called a 
                    supercritical fluid. It can be gradually compressed or expanded between gas-like and 
                    liquid-like densities, its properties (which are quite different from those of ambient
                     water) are sensitive to density. For example, for suitable pressures and temperatures it
                      can mix freely with nonpolar compounds, including most organic compounds. This makes it
                       useful in a variety of applications including high-temperature electrochemistry and as 
                       n ecologically benign solvent or catalyst in chemical reactions involving organic 
                       compounds. In Earth's mantle, it acts as a solvent during mineral formation, dissolution
                        and deposition</p>
        <p class="par2">"Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient temperature and pressure. 
            It forms precipitation in the form of rain and aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds are formed 
            from suspended droplets of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice
             may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam or water vapor. Water
              moves continually through the water cycle of evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration),
               condensation, precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.
