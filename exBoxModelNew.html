        Water is an inorganic, transparent, tasteless, odorless, and nearly
        colorless chemical substance, which is the main constituent of Earth's
        hydrosphere and the fluids of all known living organisms (in which it
        acts as a solvent[1]). It is vital for all known forms of life, even
        though it provides no calories or organic nutrients. Its chemical
        formula is H2O, meaning that each of its molecules contains one oxygen
        and two hydrogen atoms, connected by covalent bonds. Two hydrogen atoms
        are attached to one oxygen atom at an angle of 104.45°.[2]Water plays an
        important role in the world economy. Approximately 70% of the freshwater
        used by humans goes to agriculture.[6] Fishing in salt and fresh water
        bodies is a major source of food for many parts of the world. Much of
        the long-distance trade of commodities (such as oil, natural gas, and
        manufactured products) is transported by boats through seas, rivers,
        lakes, and canals. Large quantities of water, ice, and steam are used
        for cooling and heating, in industry and homes.

        The water/vapor phase curve terminates at 647.096 K (373.946 °C; 705.103
        °F) and 22.064 megapascals (3,200.1 psi; 217.75 atm).[35] This is known
        as the critical point. At higher temperatures and pressures the liquid
        and vapor phases form a continuous phase called a supercritical fluid.
        It can be gradually compressed or expanded between gas-like and
        liquid-like densities, its properties (which are quite different from
        those of ambient water) are sensitive to density. For example, for
        suitable pressures and temperatures it can mix freely with nonpolar
        compounds, including most organic compounds. This makes it useful in a
        variety of applications including high-temperature electrochemistry and
        as n ecologically benign solvent or catalyst in chemical reactions
        involving organic compounds. In Earth's mantle, it acts as a solvent
        during mineral formation, dissolution and deposition

        "Water" is the name of the liquid state of H2O at standard ambient
        temperature and pressure. It forms precipitation in the form of rain and
        aerosols in the form of fog. Clouds are formed from suspended droplets
        of water and ice, its solid state. When finely divided, crystalline ice
        may precipitate in the form of snow. The gaseous state of water is steam
        or water vapor. Water moves continually through the water cycle of
        evaporation, transpiration (evapotranspiration), condensation,
        precipitation, and runoff, usually reaching the sea.
