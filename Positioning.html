        Marine life, or sea life or ocean life, is the plants, animals and other
        organisms that live in the salt water of the sea or ocean, or the
        brackish water of coastal estuaries. At a fundamental level, marine life
        affects the nature of the planet. Marine organisms, mostly
        microorganisms, produce oxygen and sequester carbon. Shorelines are in
        part shaped and protected by marine life, and some marine organisms even
        help create new land. The term marine comes from the Latin mare, meaning
        sea or ocean.

      Most life forms evolved initially in marine habitats. By volume, oceans
      provide about 90 percent of the living space on the planet.[2] The
      earliest vertebrates appeared in the form of fish,[3] which live
      exclusively in water. Some of these evolved into amphibians which spend
      portions of their lives in water and portions on land. Other fish evolved
      into land mammals and subsequently returned to the ocean as seals,
      dolphins or whales. Plant forms such as kelp and algae grow in the water
      and are the basis for some underwater ecosystems. Plankton forms the
      general foundation of the ocean food chain, particularly the phytoplankton
      which are key primary producers.

      Marine invertebrates exhibit a wide range of modifications to survive in
      poorly oxygenated waters, including breathing tubes as in mollusc siphons.
      Fish have gills instead of lungs, although some species of fish, such as
      the lungfish, have both. Marine mammals, such as dolphins, whales, otters,
      and seals need to surface periodically to breathe air.

      There are over 200,000 documented marine species with perhaps two million
      marine species yet to be documented.[4] Marine species range in size from
      the microscopic, including phytoplankton which can be as small as 0.02
      micrometres, to huge cetaceans (whales, dolphins and porpoises), including
      the blue whale – the largest known animal reaching 33 metres (108 ft) in
      length.[5][6] Marine microorganisms, including protists, bacteria and
      viruses, have been variously estimated as constituting about 70% [7] or
      about 90% [8][1] of the total marine biomass. Marine life is studied
      scientifically in both marine biology and in biological oceanography.

      There is no life without water.[9] It has been described as the universal
      solvent for its ability to dissolve many substances,[10][11] and as the
      solvent of life.[12] Water is the only common substance to exist as a
      solid, liquid, and gas under conditions normal to life on Earth.[13] The
      Nobel Prize winner Albert Szent-Györgyi referred to water as the mater und
      matrix: the mother and womb of life.[14]

      The abundance of surface water on Earth is a unique feature in the Solar
      System. Earth's hydrosphere consists chiefly of the oceans, but
      technically includes all water surfaces in the world, including inland
      seas, lakes, rivers, and underground waters down to a depth of 2,000
      metres (6,600 ft) The deepest underwater location is Challenger Deep of
      the Mariana Trench in the Pacific Ocean, having a depth of 10,900 metres
      (6.8 mi).

      Conventionally the planet is divided into five separate oceans, but these
      oceans all connect into a single world ocean.[16] The mass of this world
      ocean is 1.35×1018 metric tons, or about 1/4400 of Earth's total mass. The
      world ocean covers an area of 3.618×108 km2 with a mean depth of 3682 m,
      resulting in an estimated volume of 1.332×109 km3.[17] If all of Earth's
      crustal surface was at the same elevation as a smooth sphere, the depth of
      the resulting world ocean would be about 2.7 kilometres (1.7 mi).

    About 97.5% of the water on Earth is saline; the remaining 2.5% is fresh
    water. Most fresh water – about 69% – is present as ice in ice caps and
    glaciers.[20] The average salinity of Earth's oceans is about 35 grams (1.2
    oz) of salt per kilogram of seawater (3.5% salt).[21] Most of the salt in
    the ocean comes from the weathering and erosion of rocks on land.[22] Some
    salts are released from volcanic activity or extracted from cool igneous
    rocks.
